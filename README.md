# hello-world
This is me learning how to use Github and learn how to code. Basically trying to learn my way around software for my job and life in general.
I am in College and in an IT internship at the moment.
I'm trying to better my skills so I can be better at my internship.
I want to be a writer and an actor, but I find coding and developing and almost all aspects of IT very interesting.
